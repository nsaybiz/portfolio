    <Container>
      I am a 4th-grade computer engineering student at Eski≈üehir Osmangazi
      University.
      <br /> <br /> I am passionate about software development and designing
      websites. I taught myself about front-end development because of that
      passion.
      <br /> <br />
      In October 2021 I joined as a volunteer intern at Piton R&D. In November
      2021, I left Piton R&D and I am currently working at Gusto as a software
      engineer.
      <br /> <br />I am still teaching myself about software engineering and
      currently, I practice with the technologies I have learned. I am looking
      for new things to learn, to be a better engineer.
